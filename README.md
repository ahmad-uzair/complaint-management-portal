# Complaint Management System

This project was a part of a technical interview which I am trying to develop further as my first hands-on experience in web development.

The frontend has been developed with Vue based on the following template:
[Vue Material Kit](https://demos.creative-tim.com/vue-material-kit)

The backend is developed with Node and Express using MongoDB as the database


## Features

Authentication: User/Admin login with credentials stored in the database. Going to user Passport for authentication but running on my own authentication method as passport kept giving Bad Request

Registration: New users can be registered on to the system

User Complaints: Users can log on to the system and file new complaints and see the details of the complaints filed by them (Still a work in progress. 70% done, Just not able to get data from mongo as it says .find is not a function )

Admin Dashboard: Admin can see all the complaints and update the status of the complaints. (Still a work in progress. 60% done. Not able to get data from mongo as it says .find is not a function)
